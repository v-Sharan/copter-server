class ProgressReporter:
    """Helper class for reporting progress from within a command handler if the
    progress is provided by another asynchronous task.

    This class provides a synchronous `notify()` method that can be called from
    another task to feed progress information into the progress reporter, and
    an asynchronous `updates()` generator that yields `Progress` objects
    that are suitable to be yielded further from an asynchronous command
    handler in a UAV driver instance.

    The typical usage pattern in the command handler is as follows:

    ```
    reporter = ProgressReporter()
    async for progress in reporter.updates():
        yield progress
    ```

    You can use the `timeout` and `fail_on_timeout` parameters of the
    `updates()` generator to implement a timeout when no progress information
    is provided in a given number of seconds. The `auto_close` parameter of the
    constructor can also be used to automatically close the progress reporter
    when a percentage equal to or larger than 100 was reported.

    Other tasks that wish to feed progress information into a running
    `updates()` generator can call the `notify()` method to update the progress
    and the `close()` method to let the generator know that there will be no
    more updates. This is typically used in conjunction with the
    `contextlib.closing()` context manager:

    ```
    with closing(reporter):
        ...
        reporter.notify(percentage=10, message="spam")
        ...
        reporter.notify(percentage=20, message="ham")
        ...
        reporter.notify(percentage=30, message="bacon")
        ...
    ```

    Suspension is also supported; the task feeding the progress reporter with
    updates can call the `suspend()` method to indicate that the operation was
    suspended and is waiting for user input. The object provided in the argument
    of `suspend()` will be forwarded to the client that initiated the operation.
