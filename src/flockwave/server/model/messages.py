        """Adds an error message to the response body.

        A common pattern in the Flockwave protocol is that a request
        (such as UAV-INF or CONN-INF) is able to target multiple identifiers
        (e.g., UAV identifiers or connection identifiers). The request is
        then executed independently for the different IDs (for instance,
        UAV status information is retrieved for all the UAV IDs). When
        one of these requests fail, we do not want to send an error message
        back to the client because the same request could have succeeded for
        *other* IDs. The Flockwave protocol specifies that for such
        messages, the response is allowed to hold an ``error`` key (whose
        value is a mapping from failed IDs to the corresponding error messages).
        This function handles the ``error`` key in such messages.

        When this function is invoked, the given ID will be added to
        the ``error`` mapping of the message. The key will be created if it
        does not exist. When the optional ``reason`` argument of this function
        is not ``None``, the given reason is added to the error mapping;
        otherwise an empty string is added to the ``error`` key of the message.

        Parameters:
            failed_id (str): the ID for which we want to add a failure
                notification
            reason (str or None): reason for the failure or ``None`` if not
                known or not provided.

        body.

        A common pattern in the Flockwave protocol is that a request
        (such as OBJ-CMD) is able to target multiple identifiers
        (e.g., UAV identifiers or connection identifiers). The request is
        then executed independently for the different IDs, and some of these
        requests may actually trigger the execution of an asynchronous
        command. When the server does not wait with the response until
        the asynchronous command completes, it may choose to create a
        CommandExecutionStatus_ object to track the execution of the command
        and then return the ID of this obejct in the response for a specific
        targeted ID. Clients will then be notified about the completion of these
        commands in separate ASYNC-RESP notifications from the server.

        When this function is invoked, the given ID will be added to
        the ``receipts`` key of the message and it will be associated to
        the ID of the given receipt. The key will be created if it
        does not exist, and the function also checks whether the ID is
        already present in the ``receipts`` key or not to ensure that keys
        are not duplicated.

        Parameters:
            id: the ID for which we want to add a receipt
            receipt: the execution status object whose ID we will use as a
