"""Helper functions to place N virtual drones in some predefined takeoff
grid.

Placement functions work in a flat Earth coordinate system where the origin
is at (0, 0, 0). The functions take the number of drones as the first
argument; additional keyword arguments may be provided for customizing the
shape provided by the placement function. The functions return the coordinates
in the flat Earth coordinate system. The caller must then map these into
GPS coordinates using a FlatEarthToGPSCoordinateTransformation_ object.
